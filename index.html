      in Him, fulfilling ancient promises, defeating sin and death through His sacrifice and
      resurrection, and establishing a spiritual kingdom. It's about a personal relationship with
      Jesus, who is seen as the way, the truth, and the life, providing hope, light, and purpose for
      those who believe. Key Aspects of the Good News: God's Love & Plan:<br />

      over death and the start of a new age. Forgiveness & New Life:<br />
